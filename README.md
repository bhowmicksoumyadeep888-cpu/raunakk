# Taxi Demand Prediction (Streamlit + ML)

##  Project Summary
This is a machine learning project that predicts taxi driver demand using time-series features like:
- hour
- day
- month
- weekday

The project converts a time-series dataset into a supervised machine learning dataset.

##  Features
- Upload Excel dataset (taxi_demand.xlsx)
- Model trains automatically inside Streamlit
- Predict demand based on selected inputs
- No terminal or pickle model file required

##  Machine Learning Model
- Random Forest Regressor
- Train-test split: 80/20
- Features extracted from datetime

##  Live Deployment
This project uses:
- *GitHub* (source code)
- *Streamlit Cloud* (hosting)
